# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow to predict
passenger survival on the Titanic dataset using a Random Forest classifier.

## What this notebook covers
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and encoding
- Train/validation split
- Model training and accuracy evaluation
- Final survival predictions for the test dataset

## Dataset
- `train.csv`: labelled training data (includes Survived)
- `test.csv`: unlabelled test data (used for prediction only)

## How to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
